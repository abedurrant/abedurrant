- 👋 Hi, I’m Abe Durrant.
- 👀 I’m a Master's in Statistics student at BYU. I primarily code in Python and R. My github currently is used mostly for my academic work, but I will be looking to put some of my personal projects on here in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about different types of statistical and machine learning. Recently, I have worked on reports involving many different types of Linear Models, Tree-based models, other Machine Learning Models, and Time Series Analysis.
